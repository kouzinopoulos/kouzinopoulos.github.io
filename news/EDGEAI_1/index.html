Then apply for this <b>two-year fully-funded</b> position as a post-doc researcher in Edge AI at the Department of Advanced Computing Sciences (DACS), part of the Faculty of Science and Engineering at Maastricht University.</i></p> <p>We are seeking a highly motivated and talented postdoctoral researcher to join our team and contribute to cutting-edge advancements in tinyML/Edge AI. The successful candidate will design, develop, and optimize AI models for deployment on autonomous, low-power, resource-constrained edge devices.</p> <h3>ðŸ”¬ Job Description</h3> <p>You will conduct research on novel Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) architectures for low-power resource-constrained edge systems, including efficient and low-latency processing of sensor data as well as energy optimization. More specifically, you will start working on the design and implementation of ML/DL architectures, including CNNs and (vision) transformers on low-power embedded systems and MCUs, including platforms like the NXP MCX N series, STM32U5, PULP/GAP9 processors, RISC-V cores and FPGAs. You will then extend your findings with automatically designed resource-constrained neural architecture search techniques. The final goal is to develop (federated) continual learning methods for edge retraining without forgetting old knowledge.</p> <h4>Your tasks will include:</h4> <ol> <li>Perform scientific research on novel architectures for edge AI algorithms and state-of-the-art AI techniques for edge devices, including model compression, quantization, neural architecture search and continual learning</li> <li>Publish results at top-tier (international) conferences and international journals</li> <li>Present the results in internal research group meetings as well as national and international scientific conferences</li> <li>Actively participate in grant acquisition activities</li> <li>Assist with educational tasks (e.g., assist labs, supervise bachelor and master students, PhD students, and internships)</li> </ol> <p>We encourage collaboration and you will also benefit from a supportive local research community as well as a strong industry and research network.</p> <h3>ðŸŽ“ Requirements</h3> <ul> <li>PhD (completed, or to be completed shortly) in Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, Machine Learning / Deep Learning, or a related field.</li> <li>Demonstrated (e.g., through publications, code, projects, etc.) interest and experience with inference and re-training of AI and ML algorithms on edge devices</li> <li>Knowledge of at least one of the following techniques and interest in developing skills in the other two:</li> <ul> <li>a. Algorithm compression / pruning / quantization for resource-constrained environments</li> <li>b. Low-power algorithm design and optimization</li> <li>c. Resource-constrained neural architecture search and (federated) continual learning techniques</li> </ul> <li>Experience in programming (Python and C/C++).</li> <li>Proficiency in English (oral and written).</li> <li>Demonstrated experience in national and/or international grant acquisition</li> <li>Excellent communication skills, and ability to collaborate in a multi-disciplinary and team-oriented research environment</li> </ul> <h3>What we offer</h3> <p><b>As Post-doc in Edge AI at Faculty of Science &amp; Engineering, you will be employed by the most international university in the Netherlands, located in the beautiful city of Maastricht. In addition, we offer you:</b></p> <ul> <li>Good employment conditions. The position is graded in scale 11 according to UFO profile Researcher, with corresponding salary based on experience ranging from â‚¬4537,00 and â‚¬6209,00 gross per month (based on a full-time employment of 38 hours per week).
