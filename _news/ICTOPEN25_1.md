Data-Driven Solutions for Lifespan and Failure Prediction in Printing Systems

---

---

Precisely predicting the lifespan and failure mechanisms of critical components in production printing are essential for manufacturers to plan maintenance, optimize production output, and improve the functionality of their products. 

This work, performed in collaboration with Canon Production Printing (CPP), proposes the use of statistical and machine learning methods to predict the lifespan and failure mechanisms of printheads. 

Accurately performing failure patterns prediction is a significant challenge given their variability and complexity and lack of reliable data. Current approaches focus mainly on rule-based classification, which struggles with high variability and implicit patterns.
