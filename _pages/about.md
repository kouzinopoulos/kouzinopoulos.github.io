I am an Assistant Professor of the Internet of Things and Coordinator of the Computer Systems Research Area in the <a href='https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/research/department-advanced-computing-sciences'>Department of Advanced Computing Sciences</a>  of the <a href='https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/about-um/faculties/faculty-science-and-engineering'>Faculty of Science and Engineering</a>  at <a href='https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/'>Maastricht University</a>. 

My research vision centers on developing sustainable, low-power, intelligent systems for the Internet of Things across high-impact application areas for society, including Digital Agriculture, Smart Cities, Healthcare and the Industry 4.0.

My research interests lie in hardware design and integration with a focus on low power consumption and miniaturization, the design, optimization and compression of algorithms based on the underlying hardware to enable intelligence at the edge, in software-hardware co-design, computer architecture, parallel and distributed computing and in GPGPU computing.
