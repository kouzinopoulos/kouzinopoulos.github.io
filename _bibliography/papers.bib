      abstract={Accurately predicting the lifespan of critical device components is essential for maintenance planning and production optimization, making it a topic of significant interest in both academia and industry. In this work, we investigate the use of survival analysis for predicting the lifespan of production printheads developed by Canon Production Printing. Specifically, we focus on the application of five techniques to estimate survival probabilities and failure rates: the Kaplan-Meier estimator, Cox proportional hazard model, Weibull accelerated failure time model, random survival forest, and gradient boosting. The resulting estimates are further refined using isotonic regression and subsequently aggregated to determine the expected number of failures. The predictions are then validated against real-world ground truth data across multiple time windows to assess model reliability. Our quantitative evaluation using three performance metrics demonstrates that survival analysis outperforms industry-standard baseline methods for printhead lifespan prediction.},

ABSTRACT = {Citizen science reinforces the development of emergent tools for the surveillance, monitoring, and early detection of biological invasions, enhancing biosecurity resilience. The contribution of farmers and farm citizens is vital, as volunteers can strengthen the effectiveness and efficiency of environmental observations, improve surveillance efforts, and aid in delimiting areas affected by plant-spread diseases and pests. This study presents a robust, user-friendly, and cost-effective smart module for citizen science that incorporates a cutting-edge developed hyperspectral imaging (HI) module, integrated in a single, energy-independent device and paired with a smartphone. The proposed module can empower farmers, farming communities, and citizens to easily capture and transmit data on crop conditions, plant disease symptoms (biotic and abiotic), and pest attacks. The developed HI-based module is interconnected with a smart embedded system (SES), which allows for the capture of hyperspectral images. Simultaneously, it enables multimodal analysis using the integrated environmental sensors on the module. These data are processed at the edge using lightweight Deep Learning algorithms for the detection and identification of Tuta absoluta (Meyrick), the most important invaded alien and devastating pest of tomato. The innovative Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based module offers open interfaces to passive surveillance platforms, Decision Support Systems (DSSs), and early warning surveillance systems, establishing a seamless environment where innovation and utility converge to enhance crop health and productivity and biodiversity protection.},

ABSTRACT = {Low-power embedded systems have been widely used in a variety of applications, allowing devices to efficiently collect and exchange data while minimizing energy consumption. However, the lack of extensive maintenance procedures designed specifically for low-power systems, coupled with constraints on anticipating faults and monitoring capacities, presents notable difficulties and intricacies in identifying failures and customized reaction mechanisms. The proposed approach seeks to address the gaps in current resource management frameworks and maintenance protocols for low-power embedded systems. Furthermore, this paper offers a trilateral framework that provides periodic prescriptions to stakeholders, a periodic control mechanism for automated actions and messages to prevent breakdowns, and a backup AI malfunction detection module to prevent the system from accessing any stress points. To evaluate the AI malfunction detection module approach, three novel autonomous embedded systems based on different ARM Cortex cores have been specifically designed and developed. Real-life results obtained from the testing of the proposed AI malfunction detection module in the developed embedded systems demonstrated outstanding performance, with metrics consistently exceeding 98%. This affirms the efficacy and reliability of the developed approach in enhancing the fault tolerance and maintenance capabilities of low-power embedded systems.},

Although there are existing systems that detect fire and monitor the presence of people in indoor areas, research on their implementation in embedded platforms is limited. This article introduces an ultra-low-power embedded system for fire detection and crowd counting using efficient deep learning methods. For the prediction of fire occurrences, environmental and gas sensor along with multilayer perceptron nodes are used. For crowd counting, a custom lightweight version of YOLOv5 is introduced, using an architecture based on ShuffleNetV2, resulting in a model with low memory requirements, high accuracy predictions, and fast inference on an embedded platform. The accuracy, power consumption, and memory requirements of the proposed system are evaluated using public datasets and datasets acquired by the environmental and image sensors, and its performance is compared to that of existing approaches.},

ABSTRACT = {Harvesting energy for IoT nodes in places that are permanently poorly lit is important, as many such places exist in buildings and other locations. The need for energy-autonomous devices working in such environments has so far received little attention. This work reports the design and test results of an energy-autonomous sensor node powered solely by solar cells. The system can cold-start and run in low light conditions (in this case 20 lux and below, using white LEDs as light sources). Four solar cells of 1 cm2 each are used, yielding a total active surface of 4 cm2. The system includes a capacitive sensor that acts as a touch detector, a crystal-accurate real-time clock (RTC), and a Cortex-M3-compatible microcontroller integrating a Bluetooth Low Energy radio (BLE) and the necessary stack for communication. A capacitor of 100 μF is used as energy storage. A low-power comparator monitors the level of the energy storage and powers up the system. The combination of the RTC and touch sensor enables the MCU load to be powered up periodically or using an asynchronous user touch activity. First tests have shown that the system can perform the basic work of cold-starting, sensing, and transmitting frames at +0 dBm, at illuminances as low as 5 lux. Harvesting starts earlier, meaning that the potential for full function below 5 lux is present. The system has also been tested with other light sources. The comparator is a test chip developed for energy harvesting. Other elements are off-the-shelf components. The use of commercially available devices, the reduced number of parts, and the absence of complex storage elements enable a small node to be built in the future, for use in constantly or intermittently poorly lit places.},

Exposure to ultraviolet radiation for prolonged periods of time can cause damage to skin cells and lead to the development of both non-melanoma cancer and melanomas. Workers in constructions sites are particularly susceptible to exposure in UV radiation due to the prolonged periods of staying in outdoors areas that offer no protection from the sun rays. This paper presents a fuzzy logic system that monitors the UV levels at particular construction sites, the environmental conditions that can affect UV as well as the location of workers and can provide notifications and alerts to both the workers and health and safety managers at each site.},

The scheme is based on the RC4 and ChaCha ciphers and uses communication channel characteristics, and especially the RSSi, to generate the encryption keys. The proposed algorithm provides an enhanced security level, due to the non static encryption keys, in both physical and transport level.},

The node can cold start with less than 30 lux. Once started, its operations can be sustained down to 20 lux. Operation at higher spreading factors or higher RF output power is also possible if the transmission interval is increased.

  abstract={The commonalities between the ALICE and FAIR experiments and their computing requirements led to the development of large parts of a common software framework in an experiment independent way. The FairRoot project has already shown the feasibility of such an approach for the FAIR experiments and extending it beyond FAIR to experiments at other facilities[1, 2]. The ALFA framework is a joint development between ALICE Online- Offline (O2) and FairRoot teams. ALFA is designed as a flexible, elastic system, which balances reliability and ease of development with performance using multi-processing and multithreading. A message- based approach has been adopted; such an approach will support the use of the software on different hardware platforms, including heterogeneous systems. Each process in ALFA assumes limited communication and reliance on other processes. Such a design will add horizontal scaling (multiple processes) to vertical scaling provided by multiple threads to meet computing and throughput demands. ALFA does not dictate any application protocols. Potentially, any content-based processor or any source can change the application protocol. The framework supports different serialization standards for data exchange between different hardware and software languages.},
